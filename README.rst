project-template - A template for scikit-learn contributions
============================================================

.. _scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org

**project-template** is a template project for scikit-learn_ compatible
extensions.

It aids development of estimators that can be used in scikit-learn pipelines
and (hyper)parameter search, while facilitating testing (including some API
compliance), documentation, open source development, packaging, and continuous
integration.

.. _documentation: https://sklearn-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html

Refer to the documentation_ to modify the template for your own scikit-learn
contribution.
